Policy plays a crucial role in influencing where, how and for whose benefit machine learning systems are developed and deployed. By synthesising evidence for use in policy development and engaging with policymakers, ML@CL contributes to the development of policy frameworks for AI that enable safe and effective use of machine learning. Recent examples of this work are provided below.

** ELISE (forthcoming; 2021) Creating a European AI Powerhouse: A Strategic Research Agenda from the European Learning and Intelligent Systems Excellence (ELISE) consortium **

Prepared by the ELISE consortium for the European Commission, this Strategic Research Agenda sets out areas in which further technology development can help create trustworthy AI systems. ML@CL synthesised expert input from consortium members to create this Agenda. 

** [Global Partnership on AI](https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/) (2020 – present) ** 

As members of the Working Group on Data Governance, ML@CL provides expert input to scope GPAI’s work programmes.

** [AI Council](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/ai-council) (2019 – present) **  

This Council advises the UK Government’s Office for AI on the policies required to support the development of the UK’s AI industry. ML@CL provides expert input to this advisory body.

** [Ada Lovelace Institute and AI Council](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/legal-mechanisms-data-stewardship/) (2021) Exploring legal mechanisms for data stewardship ** 

This review published by the Ada Lovelace Institute considers how different legal frameworks can contribute to responsible data use. Under the auspices of the Data Trusts Initiative, ML@CL contributed a chapter on the issues associated with data trusts, and provided critical feedback to shape the analysis and manuscript. 

** [DELVE](https://rs-delve.github.io) (2020) Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics ** 

Responding to policy needs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, DELVE convened leading data scientists, public health researchers and policy experts to provide data science-informed policy advice. Reports from the Initiative covered topics including: the use of face masks; the design of test, trace isolate programmes; control of hospital and health care acquisition of COVID-19; impact of school closures; and data readiness in emergencies. ML@CL convened research teams, contributed to drafting of papers, and coordinated policy engagement.

** [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/digital-technology-and-the-planet/) (2020) Digital technology and the planet ** 

This policy study convened by the Royal Society considers the action required to deploy digital technologies in the service of policy ambitions to tackle climate change. ML@CL provided expert input and contributed to drafting of papers.
