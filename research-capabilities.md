title: Research Capabilities

This is an attempt to characterize the different capabilities
that a researcher needs to be successful. The aim is to list a set of
criteria that are a useful guide for helping recognise the diversity of skills that a researcher needs to be successful.

The capabilities below are divided into two groups of five criteria. These
groups are associated with individual capabilities, the abilities you
need to succeed through personal drive. And interaction capabilities.
The abilities you need to improve those around you and benefit from
their understanding.

## Individual


1.  Coherence/Vision: this is your ability to pull together the
    different strands of your research interests into a single research
    vision. Coherence enables you to quickly summarize what your
    research interests are and why and judge which ideas are worth
    pursuing to further your agenda.

2.  Technical: this is your ability to rapidly understand and recreate
    the technical side of your domain. Depending on your field this
    might be mathematics, experimental practices (labs or simulation)
    etc. Technical capabilities allow you to cover the literature
    quickly and understand which experiments or theories you need to
    explore your scientific questions.

3.  Doubt: Knowing when you don't know is more important than the
    knowing itself.

4.  Independence/Delivery: Being able to set goals and reliably work
    towards them.

5.  Passion: Being driven by the choice of problem and a thirst for
    discovery for the sake of discovery.

## Group

1.  Sensitivity /patience: Being aware that not everyone understands
    what you understand and taking value from their contributions and
    their understanding.

2.  Mentorship/companionship: Being able to support and guide your
    fellow researchers either as peer or as a mentor or sharing your
    perspective as a mentee.

3.  Vision: Being able to project an inspirational view on the ideas
    that you feel passionate about that draws those around you into the
    problem.

4.  Education: Being able to share your technical understanding,

5.  Inclusivity: Being aware of those who are being left out of a
    conversation and capable of turning the conversation to bring them
    in.
