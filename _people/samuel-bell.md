I apply the principles and methods of psychology to understanding neural network behaviour.

I’m a machine learning PhD student in the ML@CL group at the University of Cambridge (Queens’ College), supervised by Prof. Neil Lawrence. During my master’s I worked on deep learning and natural language processing at the Cambridge Computer Laboratory. I did my bachelor’s in computer science at the University of Manchester, graduating 2013.

In between, I’ve also simulated financial crises in market risk at Goldman Sachs, built new retail banks at Thought Machine, and developed next generation credit scores at Credit Kudos.

I’m also the Founder and Chair of The Preptrack Foundation, a registered charity building technology for HIV prevention. Our first app, [Preptrack](https://preptrack.co.uk/), helps people who use PrEP, the medication that eliminates risk of HIV infection.

If you’re interested in what I do, please do drop me a line. My email is sjb326 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk.
