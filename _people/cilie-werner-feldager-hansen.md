I am a Ph.D. candidate visiting from the Technical University of Denmark and I am particularly interested in the geometry of probabilistic latent variable models and uncertainty quantification. Currently, I am working with my host-supervisor Professor Neil Lawrence on developing a prior for the latent variables to incorporate Bayesian differential geometry in the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. In Denmark, I am supervised by Professors Lars Kai Hansen and SÃ¸ren Hauberg and jointly, we are working on invariant probabilistic latent representations under symmetric transformations. I received my Master's degree in Physics from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen in Denmark and before starting my PhD studies, I worked for three years with data analysis of clinical trials in a large pharmaceutical company (Novo Nordisk).
